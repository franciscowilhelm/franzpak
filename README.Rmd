# franzpak

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

I created franzpak to collect some utility functions that I have written over the years.
They stem from my routine use cases for R, which include:
- clean/tidy/transform social science questionnaire data (e.g., `scoreItemsMulti()`)
- analyze questionnaire data using quantitative methods 
- including interfacing of R with Mplus thanks to the excellent MplusAutomation (e.g., `coef_wrapper()`)
- including analysis of multilevel / diary data (e.g., `cortable_multilevel`).

Therefore, users may find useful functions here for similar purposes.


## Installation

You can install the development version of franzpak like so:

``` r
# FILL THIS IN! HOW CAN PEOPLE INSTALL YOUR DEV PACKAGE?
```

Currently I do not plan to submit to CRAN, because of the added hassle and because my code is not compliant with CRAN standards (as I use tidyverse notation and quasi-quotation).
